# MLBot-test
Please check the source code for any errors if you want to take the whole code(s) for your discord bot, since I may have not coded everything in right

## What is MLBot?
MLbot is a multi-functional W.I.P discord bot made by me, I have browsed through countless youtube tutorials and other repositories to complete coding everything for this bot.
MLBot has:

1. Moderation commands
2. Music commands
3. Other fun/misc. commands.

Note: This bot is still under development, this is just the first version of the bot, yet to be hosted.
